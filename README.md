# Multi-Minimum-Problem-in-ML
Some engineering fixes are discussed in solving multi minima problem using Machine learning. The simple spring displacement and Shrodinger equations are examined. These show multiple minima in a solution domain, where Machine learning codes fail to converge. I will be putting a jupyter file on this site which can be run interactively with all the source code and reference.
